<ol>
  <li>Clone this repo using your terminal <code>git clone https://github.com/thatquietkid/currency-convertor</code> or any other method you feel comfortable with</li>
  <li>Get your API key <a href="https://freecurrencyapi.com/">here</a></li>
  <li>Create a '.env' file and put your API key as <code> API_KEY="---" </code>  </li>
  <li>Open your terminal and run the command <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
  <li>By this point, your file is all set up and ready to go. Launch the terminal and run the file using <code>python currency.py</code>(make sure to be in the same directory as the file!)</li>
</ol>
